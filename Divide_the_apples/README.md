Take input n, mn, and mx from the user.
<br>
Output:
<br>
Print whether the numbers between mn and mx are divisors of “n” or not. If mn=mx, show that this is not a range, and mn is equal to mx. Show the result for that number.
 
<h2>Description:</h2>

First of all, try block is created and three input in integer form is stored in variables inside try block to handle Value error. Then, If else statement is used to set the conditions for this problem. At last, for loop is used to print whether given range is divisor of "n" or not.
