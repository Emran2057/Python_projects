<h1>The Next Palindrome</h1>

<h2>Problem Statement:</h2>

A palindrome is a string that, when reversed, is equal to itself. Example of the palindrome includes: 676, 616, mom, 100001.
<br>
You have to take a number as an input from the user. You have to find the next palindrome corresponding to that number. Your first input should be the number of test cases and then take all the cases as input from the user.
<br>
Input:
<br>
3
<br>
451
<br>
10
<br>
2133
<br>
Output:
<br>
Next palindrome for 451 is 454
<br>
Next palindrome for 10 is 11
<br>
Next palindrome for 2311 is 2222
 
<h2>Description:</h2>

First of all, you need to define a function which help to number is palindrome is or not by converting numbers into string. Then, define another function which help to find next palindrome by using while and while loop is set to not above function until it return next palindrome. Then, create two variable to store the input from the user in integer form and empty list and that input is used in for loop range to input the test case numbers in integer form and append in the empty list. Again, that input is used for loop range and print all the test number next palindrome by using above function and elements are passed to that function.


<h2>Note:</h2>

* You can run this code by downloading or copy it in any plateform which support python.
