<h1>Divide the apples</h1>

<h2>Problem Statement:</h2>

You visited a restaurant called CodeWithHarry, and the food items in that restaurant are sorted, based on their amount of calories. You have to reserve this list of food items containing calories.
<br>
You have to use the following three methods to reserve a list:

* Inbuild method of python
* List name [::-1] slicing trick
* Swap the first element with the last one and second element with second last one and so on like, [6 7 8 34 5] -> [5 34 8 7 6]
<br>
Input:
<br>
Take a list as an input from the user
<br>
[5, 4, 1]
<br>
Output:
[1, 4, 5]
<br>
[1, 4, 5]
<br>
[1, 4, 5]
<br>
All three methods give the same results!
 
<h2>Description:</h2>

First of all, create a variable to store the input in integer form for size of list need and also create a variable to store empty list. Then, run for loop in range which is given above and ask input the element of list by user in integer form and append the element in the empty time. Then, print the list and create 3 copy of list. Then, use reverse() inbuid method in one copy of list and print it. Then, use [::-1] in one copy of list and print it. Then, use for loop to swap the element and only apply in half of list in one copy of list and print it. Then, use If else statement to set condition to print All three methods give the same results!


<h2>Note:</h2>

* You can run this code by downloading or copy it in any plateform which support python.
