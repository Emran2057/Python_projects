<h1>Your Age</h1>

<h2>Problem Statement:</h2>

Take age or year of birth as an input from the user. Store the input in one variable. Your program should detect whether the entered input is age or year of birth and tell the user when they will turn 100 years old.
<br>
Here are a few instructions that you must have to follow:

1. Do not use any type of module like DateTime or date utils.
2. Users can optionally provide a year, and your program must tell their age in that particular year.
3. Your code should handle all sorts of errors like :
* You are not yet born
* You seem to be the oldest person alive
* You can also handle any other errors, if possible!
 
<h2>Description:</h2>

First of all, you need to take input from the user that may be year or age in integer form. Then, create one variable to store the current age if input is year. Then, define a function to tell the age in that particular year by creating two variables to store the age from current year to that particular year. Then, If else condition is used for telling the age in that particular year, handle oldest person alive error and also if the person age is behond 150 (it print Please! Enter the correct year to check the age). Then, If else statement is used to set the condition for input age and input year and above function is used.


<h2>Note:</h2>

* You can run this code by downloading or copy it in any plateform which support python.
